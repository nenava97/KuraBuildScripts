#This script practices scp & ssh by demonstrating remote login & file transfer functions
#Note: User should know the password for remote user

#Provide a menu to user to select ssh or scp
#Based on user selection ask for user name and ip-address.
#For scp ask user for direction of copy
#remote to local
#local to remote.
#copy file to destination home directory with same source file name.
#Ask for source/destination file location. If no destination location is provided
#If user gives destination along with filename, keep that as destination filename.
#If user provides only destination location (no file name), keep as source file name
